# Good to have:
- Make a page to create playlist and add music more easier
- Add ref on MusicItem to track it size and adjust the item depending on its size instead of the media query
- Add ref on Body content to track it size and adjust the rest depending on its size instead of the media query
- /explore => make pages for each filters instead of filtering content (e.g => /explore/artists, /explore/musics)
- Artist page make top part sticky
- <a> tag for links (accessibility) instead of onClick
- Add expand/resize button on sidebar

# Bugs:
- Upload picture can have more than 1 share link
-
