# Must have:

1. Listening
- Frontend & Backend & Stream => Listening to Music

2. Liked Playlist
- Backend => On user creation, add playlist liked songs
- Backend => on music like add to Liked Songs playlist

3. A bunch of random stuff xD
- Frontend => Register tell user they can like genre after
- Frontend => Loading icon and check server response if alive every 5sec
- Frontend => Add assets for explore page empty, 500 page & error page
- Frontend => About-us page : Copy of the Landing page without the register button.
- Frontend => Legal page: ask gpt
- Frontend => Home Page *when not logged in*: Landing page with great looking image and nice & short description, with a button that leads to the register page. At the bottom, there'll be all necessary informations about the site (name details, creation date, goal of the app, who am i etc...).


# Good to have:
- Backend & Frontend => Add previous password if the user want to change password
- Backend & Frontend => Add forgot password feature
- Load next music when listening music
- Make a page to create playlist and add music more easier
- Add ref on MusicItem to track it size and adjust the item depending on its size instead of the media query
- Add ref on Body content to track it size and adjust the rest depending on its size instead of the media query
- /explore => make pages for each filters instead of filtering content (e.g => /explore/artists, /explore/musics)
- Artist page make top part sticky
- <a> tag for links (accessibility) instead of onClick
- Add expand/resize button on sidebar
- Api client interceptor in axios client => get err message 

# Bugs:
- Upload picture can have more than 1 share link
- Update social media
